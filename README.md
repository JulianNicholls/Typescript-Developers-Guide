### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for more than 10 years. Over that time,
I have tried many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one
that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
