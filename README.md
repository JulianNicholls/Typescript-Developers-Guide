# Typescript, the Complete Developer's Guide

This is the code from Stephen Grider's [Typescript, the Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide) course on Udemy.

## Progress

132 - Section 11 - Stats app, Complete.

## Changes from Stephen

* I'm using Yarn instead of npm.

* I always name a todo list item as a Task, rather than a Todo.

* I spell colour correctly :-).

* I have called the longitude inside a location `long` rather than `lng`.

* My map is centred on the UK at a reasonable zoom level, and my Company and
User classes create locations more or less within the UK and its surrounding seas.

* I've added (very) basic styling to the maps app.

* Generally, my classes have no `public` data, it's stored as `private` with
an accessor `get` function.

* My linked list keeps track of its length, and my Node is called `LLNode`
because lots of other `Node` classes are already defined in various modules.

* My `CSVFileReader read()` and `MatchReader load()` functions return the
read data, because there's no good reason not to.

* My `HTMLReport` class takes a filename in the constructor.

* I chose to make the `Summary` static function return a console wins analysis.

### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for more than 10 years. Over that time,
I have tried many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one
that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
